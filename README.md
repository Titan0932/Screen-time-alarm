# Screen_time_alarm


This program reminds you to take some time off your screen and stretch out every specified time period. 
Just Enter the seconds interval you think you might need to stretch out and press start. 
It automatically starts counting for you and alarms you at the time. 
After you're done stretching, hit 'I took a break' and it resumes the counting. 
You may hit 'I took a break' if you took one before the time had elapsed. 
And, finally hit, 'Finished Working' once you're done.
